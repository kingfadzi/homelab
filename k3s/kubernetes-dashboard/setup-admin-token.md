This setup grants the `admin-user` service account full administrative access across the entire cluster.

### Step 1: Ensure the Service Account Exists
First, confirm that the service account is correctly created and exists:

```bash
kubectl get serviceaccount admin-user -n kubernetes-dashboard
```

### Step 2: Check for Secrets Manually
Check if there are any secrets associated with the service account, which might not have been listed before due to a transient error or delay:

```bash
kubectl describe serviceaccount admin-user -n kubernetes-dashboard
```

### Step 3: Manually Create a Token
If there are still no tokens, you can manually create a token for this service account. This can be done by creating a secret of type `kubernetes.io/service-account-token`. Here's how to do it:

1. **Create the Token Secret:**
   You can explicitly create a secret and annotate it to associate with the `admin-user` service account:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: admin-user-token
     namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/service-account.name: admin-user
   type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
   ```

   Save this to a file (e.g., `admin-user-token.yaml`) and apply it:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f admin-user-token.yaml
   ```

2. **Verify Creation and Describe Secret:**
   After creating the secret, ensure it's linked to the service account and contains a token:

   ```bash
   kubectl describe secret admin-user-token -n kubernetes-dashboard
   ```

   The output should show a `token` field under `Data` that you can use to authenticate.

### Step 4: Use the Token
To use the token for accessing the Kubernetes Dashboard:

1. Decode the token from the secret:

   ```bash
   kubectl get secret admin-user-token -n kubernetes-dashboard -o=jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode
   ```

2. Copy the decoded token.
3. Visit the Kubernetes Dashboard URL.
4. Choose the "Token" authentication method and paste the token.

### Security Note
Be cautious when handling tokens, especially those with cluster-admin privileges, as they provide complete access to your Kubernetes cluster. Ensure they are kept secure and only used where absolutely necessary.
